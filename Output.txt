Everything we see around us, right from the moment we step outside our home is part of nature. The trees, animals, landscape, flowers, trees, breeze, sunlight, everything that makes our surroundings so beautiful and mesmerizing are part of nature. Nature does not arise spontaneously but needs years and years to bloom and blossom.

According to researchers, nature we see today has developed in 4.5 billion years. Initially, the earth was not sustainable for any kind of living thing. The atmosphere had no to very little oxygen, and the same was the case with water. The land made of molten magma and the atmosphere was toxic to survive. Slowly, the earth cooled down, and life started blooming on it. It began to rain, and nature, as we see today, was formed. This nature then gifted the earth with living creatures like animals, birds, and finally, humans.

It is the Mother Nature who never harms us but always nurtures us. By providing us fruits and vegetables, it nurtures our body. By providing us water hydrates our body, and by providing oxygen, it cleanses our body. It is usually seen that people who live close to nature, especially the villagers live a somewhat happy life as compared to the people living amidst the high hovering skyscrapers. Nature provides our ears sweet sound of birds, rejuvenates us with fresh air, breeze fills our soul with joy, and inspires to flow like the river. Nature provides the raw material for economic development as well.

Unfortunately, humans today are polluting nature in such a way that the healing pace has fallen slowly. The use of plastic, emission of CO2, production of industrial waste, increased use of chemicals, deforestation, poaching, and oil spillage in water bodies are serious concerns today. These are not only polluting nature and are also degrading the quality of the environment needed for the survival of not only animals and birds but also humans.

Nature has inspired not only poets and writers but also the common man. All the great poets and writers like William Wordsworth have always given the nature a significant space in their writings and musings. Nature has the power to take us to the place of peace and imagination to free the emotions that been locked inside us. If those emotions and feelings get freed, then there is immense power in them to bring on the changes that are unexpected. Many people are currently working and getting linked with the nature conservation organizations to preserve and enhance the nature and beauty around us.

By taking small steps like planting trees, using biodegradable materials, stopping water pollution, animal conversation, and keeping our surroundings clean, we can help Mother Nature to breathe again and rejuvenate in the same way it helps us.
Nature can be defined as the physical world and the life which interacts with it. It is the total of the ecosystem, animals, birds, plants, landscapes, and humans. Nature not just includes the life but also is the host for the non-living physical entities as well. Nature took billions of years to grow and form to shape what we see today.

Nature has given us everything. The sweet sound of chirping birds to hear every morning, crystal clear water to drink every day, a cold breeze to feel, pure air to breathe in, and mouth-watering food to eat is entirely pleasing. Mother Nature has always nourished us. It has always taken care of us and has provided us with all the necessities of life. It has provided shelter to birds and animals, shade to travelers, and even branches to tie swigs for children to enjoy.

Today, humans are harming the environment by polluting and damaging it. Many organizations are working to make nature cleaner. It is our duty to keep our surroundings clean and use biodegradable material to keep nature clean. We have to revive Mother Nature, who has always nourished and nurtured us.
